Customizing theme
-------------------------------------------
Theme options are in the Appearance > Customize Tab in Admin. Here you can select from different color scheme options. You can also add your own logo, header, background, social media links and feature text area (for homepage just below slider).


Homepage Layout
-------------------------------------------
Homepage layout can be set by making a page and selecting "Custom Home Page" from the Template options.
 - The top featured post (below slider) will appear when that post is set as sticky.
 - Recent Posts. The latest 3 posts are picked up and displayed under the recent posts section. A featured image will have to be added for the thumbnail to appear.
 - Homepage slider instructions are below.


Adding images to homepage slider
-------------------------------------------
A post category called "Featured" and with the slug "featured" will have to be added to your post categories. The slider will pick up the latest 3 posts from this category and the image if you have set a featured image. Image size should be at least 960px width and 400px height.
