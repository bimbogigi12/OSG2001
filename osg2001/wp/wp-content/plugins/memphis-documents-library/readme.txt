= Add Page Templates to Memphis Documents Library =

To add templates to custom posts you will need to download a plugin "Custom Post Type Page Template".  This will allow you to add templates to any custom post including mdocs posts.  Here is the link to the plugin: [https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-page-template/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-page-template/)

= Non Member Can't Download =

If you are getting an issue with non member not being able to download files try this fix.

* Go to the Dashboard > Memphis Docs Tab
* Check the check box beside the Name label of the table
* Click on the Batch Edit button
* Check the NM check boxes for every file
* Save you work
* Sign out of WordPress and then try to see if you can now download the file.

= Preview not Working =

First thing to try is go to Setting > Disable Third Party Includes: > Bootstrap and check the check box.  Try the preview again.  If that doesn't work the second most like issue is your themes css if conflicting with mDocs functionality.  The second problem is hard to fix it requires you to debug you site and check and change values in order to get the preview to show.  If you need assistance on the css to edit please feel free to contact me.

Another issue with preview is with Google docs viewer which is Memphis Docs default viewer.  I have noticed lately that the preview will not load sometime if a refresh the page it seems to solve the problem but is not really a solution.  The only solution that I have found is to change to the Box previewer.  I have an not issue with this previewer and works every time.

= 404 Error when trying to access document page =

If you get a 404 error when trying to access your Memphis documents pages try going to Setting>Permalinks and pressing Save.  This may solve the issue, if it doesn't please contact me for more support.

= Memphis Documents Library look wrong in IE =

Add the following code to your theme right under the `<head>` tag this will turn off compatibility mode for IE.
`<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=11; IE=10; IE=9; IE=8; IE=7; IE=EDGE" />`

= Importing Into Memphis Documents Library =

There are two type of imports you can choose from.

**Keep Existing Saved Variables**

* Is the safest way to import.  This option keeps all your current files and only imports new ones. 
If a file that is being imported matches one on the current system, the one on the current system will be left untouched,
and you will have to manually import these files.

**Overwrite Saved Variables**

* Is a good when you have a empty documents library or you at looking to refresh your current library.  
This method deletes all files, posted and version on the current system. After the method has completed you will
get a list of all the conflicts that have occurred make note of them.
Please take great care in using this method as there is little to no return.

= Exporting Out of Memphis Documents Library =

When you click the export button the document library will create a ZIP files for you to save to your computer.
This compressed data, will contain your documents, saved variables, media and posts tied to each document.
Once you've saved the download file, you can use the Import function in another WordPress installation to import the content from this site.

= ImageMagick PDF Issue =

If you are getting error like this when displaying the description in mDocs:

Exception type: ImagickException
Exception message: not authorized ..... @ error/constitute.c/ReadImage/412

In file /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml (or /etc/ImageMagick/policy.xml)
